# Civic Issue Reporting System 🏙️

A web-based platform that allows citizens to report civic issues and track their status, while enabling government authorities to manage and resolve reported problems.

> ⚠️ Note: This project currently has the **frontend deployed**.  
> The **backend is not connected** in the live demo, so actions like login, signup, and issue submission will not work online.

## ⚠️ Important Notice (Backend Status)

- The backend server is **not deployed**.
- API-based features like:
  - Login
  - Signup
  - Reporting issues  
  will show **“Server not responding”** in the live demo.

This is expected behavior because the frontend is running without a backend connection.
